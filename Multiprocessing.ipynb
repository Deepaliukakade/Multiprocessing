    "#Q1. What is multiprocessing in python? Why is it useful?\n",
    "'''Multiprocessing in Python\n",
    "Multiprocessing in Python is a technique where multiple processes are used to execute tasks concurrently. \n",
    "Each process runs in its own memory space, and changes made to data in one process do not affect other processes.\n",
    "Why Multiprocessing is Useful\n",
    "Multiprocessing is useful for several reasons:\n",
    "True Parallelism: Unlike multithreading in Python, which is limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), multiprocessing allows true parallelism, where multiple processes can execute tasks simultaneously, improving overall performance.\n",
    "Utilizing Multiple CPU Cores: Multiprocessing can take advantage of multiple CPU cores, making it an effective way to speed up computationally intensive tasks.\n",
    "Avoiding GIL Limitations: By using separate processes, multiprocessing avoids the limitations imposed by the GIL, which can hinder performance in multithreaded applications.\n",
    "Improved Responsiveness: Multiprocessing can improve responsiveness in applications by performing time-consuming tasks in separate processes, allowing the main process to remain responsive.'''"

    "#Q2. What are the differences between multiprocessing and multithreading?\n",
    "Differences between Multiprocessing and Multithreading\n",
    "Here are the main differences between multiprocessing and multithreading:\n",
    "1. Process vs Thread\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Multiple processes are used to execute tasks concurrently. Each process has its own memory space.\n",
    "Multithreading: Multiple threads are used to execute tasks concurrently within a single process. All threads share the same memory space.\n",
    "2. Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Not affected by the GIL, allowing true parallelism.\n",
    "Multithreading: Affected by the GIL, which can limit parallelism in CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "3. Memory and Resources\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Each process has its own memory space, and changes made to data in one process do not affect other processes.\n",
    "Multithreading: All threads share the same memory space, and changes made to data by one thread can affect other threads.\n",
    "4. Communication and Synchronization\n",
    "Multiprocessing: More complex communication and synchronization mechanisms are required, such as queues, pipes, or shared memory.\n",
    "Multithreading: Simpler communication and synchronization mechanisms can be used, such as locks, semaphores, or condition variables.\n",
    "5. Overhead and Performance\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Creating a new process has higher overhead compared to creating a new thread. However, multiprocessing can provide better performance for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "Multithreading: Creating a new thread has lower overhead compared to creating a new process. However, multithreading may not provide significant performance benefits for CPU-bound tasks due to the GIL.\n",
    "6. Use Cases\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Suitable for CPU-bound tasks, such as scientific computing, data processing, and machine learning.\n",
    "Multithreading: Suitable for I/O-bound tasks, such as GUI applications, network programming, and concurrent I/O operations."

    "#Q4. What is a multiprocessing pool in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "'''Multiprocessing Pool in Python\n",
    "A multiprocessing pool in Python is a way to manage a group of worker processes that can be used to execute tasks concurrently. The multiprocessing.Pool class provides a convenient way to parallelize the execution of a function across multiple input values.\n",
    "Why is Multiprocessing Pool Used?\n",
    "Multiprocessing pool is used for several reasons:\n",
    "Efficient Parallelization: Multiprocessing pool allows you to parallelize the execution of a function across multiple input values, making it an efficient way to speed up computationally intensive tasks.\n",
    "Easy to Use: The multiprocessing.Pool class provides a simple and intuitive API for parallelizing tasks, making it easy to use even for developers without extensive parallel programming experience.\n",
    "Automatic Process Management: The pool manages the worker processes automatically, including creating, starting, and joining the processes, which simplifies the development process.\n",
    "Methods of Multiprocessing Pool\n",
    "Some common methods of the multiprocessing.Pool class include:\n",
    "map(): Applies a function to every item in an input iterable and returns a list of the results.\n",
    "apply_async(): Applies a function to a single input value and returns an AsyncResult object that can be used to retrieve the result.\n",
    "close(): Prevents any more tasks from being submitted to the pool.\n",
